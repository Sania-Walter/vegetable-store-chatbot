The Vegetable Store Chatbot is an AI-powered conversational assistant developed using the Rasa Framework to streamline the online vegetable ordering process. It interacts with customers in natural language, allowing them to browse available vegetables, place orders with specific quantities, check prices, explore offers, confirm orders, and make paymentsâ€”all through a simple chat interface. The chatbot also collects essential delivery details such as name, phone number, and address to complete the order. This system enhances customer convenience, reduces manual workload, and brings automation to small-scale vegetable retailers.
